# ASCSII-IMAGE
This will turn any image or video into ASCII art

Uses:".'`^\",:;Il!i><~+_-?][}{1)(|\\/tfjrxnuvczXYUJCLQ0OZmwqpdbkhao*#MW&8%B@$" as a list of ASCII characters
Each of these characters were found how dense it was in terms of its pixels, and put in order from least to greatest density.

To read from the image I use OpenCV.
